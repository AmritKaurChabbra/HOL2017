# HOL2017

### Prerequisites
node 4+ (preferably the LTS)

>**NOTE**  
NPM v5 has known bugs that will cause the JET CLI tool to fail on installation. Make sure you are on an early version of NPM than 5.x
To check your NPM version, type: `npm --version`  


### Installation
Clone the project and run the following commands from the root of the project folder:
`npm install -g ojet-cli`

### Running
If you are new to Oracle JET, we recommend you start with the **Beginners Start** project. 
Change to this directory and follow the steps outlined in the README.

If you have been working with JET for sometime, and would like to take an existing project to another level. 
The **Advanced Start** project is the place for you. Change to that directory and follow the steps outline in the README.
