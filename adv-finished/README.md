# Advanced Hands-On-Lab 2018  

### Installation
Clone the project and run the following commands from the root of the project folder:
```
npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli   /** only needed if you don't already have the JET CLI installed **/

npm install
```

### Running
Use the following command to run the project from the root of the project folder:
```
ojet serve
```

### Editing the project
Make all code edits in the /src folder.  
If you make edits to any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files while the ojet serve command is running, 
the change will automatically be pushed to the /web folder and the browser will refresh.

Adding or removing libraries from the project will require a rebuild.
